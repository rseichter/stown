stown
=====

Stow file system objects by managing symlinks. "stown" was inspired by [GNU
Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), which I found very useful but too
unwieldly for my personal use. GNU Stow relies on a number of Perl modules and
can be a hassle to install on minimalistic systems. In contrast, stown only
requires Python 3.9 or newer, without additional modules.

If you are looking for a lightweight tool instead of a full-fledged symlink
farm manager, stown might be for you.

Example use case

If you store your dotfiles in a special repository, like many of us do, the
following simple statement can help you quickly set up a new user account with your

That is of course just a brief teaser an not much to go by. The documentation website
provides detailed information about [how stown is
