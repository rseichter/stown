stown
=====

Stow file system objects by managing symlinks. "stown" was inspired by [GNU
Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), which I found very useful but too
unwieldly for my personal use. GNU Stow relies on a number of Perl modules and
can be a hassle to install on minimalistic systems. In contrast, stown only
requires Python 3.9 or newer, without additional modules.

If you are looking for a lightweight tool instead of a full-fledged symlink
farm manager, stown might be for you.

Installing
----------

To install the [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/stown/), you can use
this shell command:

```bash
pip install stown
```

Usage
-----

*Always create backups before using stown!*

The following example simulates linking the contents of a dotfile repository to
a user's home directory. The `--dry-run` flag causes the necessary steps to be
printed only; no changes will be made.

```bash
stown --dry-run $HOME /path/to/dotfiles
# "stown --help" shows syntax
```

Note that the prefix `dot-` is converted to a dot character in resulting symlinks,
for example a link `$HOME/.vimrc` pointing to `/path/to/dotfiles/dot-vimrc`.

Strategy
--------

With default settings, stown will abort operations to protect existing target
file objects (symlinks, files and directories). This can however lead to
half-finished jobs, so using `--dry-run` prior to any live operation is
recommended. You can use the `--force` flag to permit overwriting existing file
objects, but this is inherently risky. Remember to create backups beforehand,
because here be monsters!
