[#about]
== About

"stown" manages file system object mapping via symlinks. It was inspired by GNU
Stow, which I found very useful but too unwieldly for my personal use. GNU Stow
relies on a number of Perl modules and can be a hassle to install on
minimalistic systems. In contrast, stown requires only Python 3.9 or newer,
without any additional dependencies.

If you are looking for a lightweight tool instead of a full-fledged symlink
farm manager, stown might be for you.

Documentation is provided in https://www.seichter.de/stown/[HTML] and
https://www.seichter.de/stown/stown.pdf[PDF] format. Source code is hosted
https://github.com/rseichter/stown[here].

[#install]
== Installing

To install the https://pypi.org/project/stown/[PyPI package], you can use
this shell command:

```bash
pip install stown
```

[#cli]
== Command line options

[#example]
== Example usage

The following example simulates linking the contents of a dotfile repository to
a user's home directory. The `--dry-run` flag causes the necessary steps to be
printed only; no changes will be made.

```bash
stown --dry-run $HOME /path/to/dotfiles
```

[#strategy]
== Strategy

Terminology: In stown parlance, _source_ means any existing file object
(regular file, directory or symlink). _Targets_ are paths in the file system
where stown is meant to create symlinks pointing to sources.

When used with default options, stown will routinely abort operations in an
attempt to protect existing targets. This can however lead to half-finished
jobs. Using `--dry-run` prior to any live operation is recommended to lower
that risk. Note that stown limits its recursive approach to managing links to a
maximum depth of 10, which is typically sufficient. The `--depth` option can be
used to change the limit.

WARNING: Always create backups before using stown, because here be monsters!

Using the `--force` flag gives stown explicit permission to overwrite existing
file objects. Sources are processed in the order specified by the user. In case
of name collisions, later changes may not override earlier ones unless
`--force` is specified.

As an example, let us imagine a directory `mike` originally containg the
following:

[%unbreakable]
----
include::before.txt[]
----

This is the resulting content after `stow --force zulu alpha bravo`:

[%unbreakable]
----
include::after.txt[]
----

Symlinks are created using relative paths with stown's default settings. Using
the `--absolute` flag changes the path type. Links with relative paths can make
changing the directory structure easier. For example, renaming the parent
folder `mike` to `november` would not break the relative links shown above.

Unless disabled via the `--no-dot` option, the prefix `dot-` in source names is
converted to a leading dot character in symlinks, as shown with
`zulu/.editorconfig` pointing to `bravo/dot-editorconfig`. This makes handling
dotfiles easier, disabling their respective special effects and lifting their
"hidden" status.

[#env]
== Environment variables

* `STOWN_LOGLEVEL` can be used like the `--loglevel` option. Supported values
  are the predefined Python logging levels CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO or
  DEBUG. Values are case insensitive.

* `STOWN_LOGPATH` corresponds to the `--logpath` option. As per convention, a
  standalone dash `-` is interpreted as an alias for the standard output
  stream, which is also the default.
